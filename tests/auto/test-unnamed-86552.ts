```typescript
import { Clarinet, Tx, Chain, Account, types } from "https://deno.land/x/clarinet@v0.14.1/mod.ts";

Clarinet.test({
  name: "[Critical] - Unchecked arithmetic operations",
  async fn(chain: Chain, accounts: Map<string, Account>) {
    let deployer = accounts.get("deployer")!;
    let wallet_1 = accounts.get("wallet_1")!;
    let block = chain.mineBlock([
      // Assuming the contract has a function `unchecked_arithmetic` that performs the unchecked operations
      Tx.contractCall("unnamed", "unchecked_arithmetic", [], deployer.address),
    ]);
    // Check if the transaction is successful
    block.receipts[0].result.expectOk().expectBool(true);

    // Now let's test with some values that could cause overflow
    block = chain.mineBlock([
      Tx.contractCall("unnamed", "unchecked_arithmetic", [types.uint(2 ** 64 - 1)], wallet_1.address),
    ]);
    // The transaction should fail due to overflow
    block.receipts[0].result.expectErr().expectUint(1);
  },
});
```

This test first calls the `unchecked_arithmetic` function with no arguments and expects it to succeed. Then it calls the same function with a very large number that could cause an overflow. The test expects this call to fail. The actual arguments and expected results may vary depending on the implementation of the `unchecked_arithmetic` function.
